     Request a basic DBS check
   </h1>

   <p>Apply for a basic Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check to get a copy of your criminal record. This is called ‘basic disclosure’. It costs £23. It’s available for people working in England and Wales.</p>

   <div class="govuk-inset-text">
     <p>This page is also available in Welsh (<a href="javascript:void(0)">Cymraeg</a>).</p>
   </div>

   <p>You can also get a basic DBS check if you live in Northern Ireland or Scotland but the job you’re applying for is in England or Wales.</p>

   <div class="govuk-inset-text">
     <p>There’s a different way to apply if you’re applying for a job in <a href="javascript:void(0)">Northern Ireland</a> or <a href="javascript:void(0)">Scotland</a>.</p>
   </div>

   <p>The check will only show convictions that are not ‘spent’, for example some types of caution will disappear after 3 months.</p>

   <p>You must be 16 or over to apply.</p>

   <p>It usually takes up to 14 days for you to receive your certificate.</p>




   <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need</h2>

   <p>You might need to create an account and prove your identity before you can apply for a basic DBS check.</p>

   <p>You’ll also need:</p>

   <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
     <li>all your addresses for the last 5 years and the dates you lived there</li>
     <li>your National Insurance number</li>
     <li>your passport</li>
     <li>your driving licence</li>
   </ul>

   <br />



<div class="">
