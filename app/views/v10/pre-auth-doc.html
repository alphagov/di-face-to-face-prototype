      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Prove your identity online using one of the following photo ID documents</h1>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">UK photocard driving licence</h2>

      <p>You can use a valid full or provisional driving licence with your photo on it.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Biometric passport (or 'ePassport')</h2>

      <p>Biometric passports allow you to go through eGates at airpots. All valid UK passports are biometric passports but not all non-UK passports are. To check if you have a biometric passport, look for a small rectangular symbol on the front cover.</p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        If your UK passport has expired, you can still use it to prove your identity up until 18 months after the expiry date.
      </div>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Biometric Residence Permit (BRP)</h2>

      <p>You can use a valid BRP to prove your identity. Your BRP holds your personal details, photo and fingerprints if you are a UK visa holder. It shows your immigration status and entitlements while you remain in the United Kingdom.</p>
