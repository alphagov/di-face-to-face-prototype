      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Tell us if you have one of the following types of photo ID</h1>

      <p>This will help us find the best way for you to prove your identity.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">UK photocard driving licence</h2>

      <p>You can use a full or provisional UK driving licence if it:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>is a plastic photocard, not a paper licence</li>
        <li>has not expired</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">UK passport</h2>

      <p>You can use any UK passport if it has not expired.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-UK passport with a biometric chip</h2>

      <p>You can use a non-UK passport if it:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>has a biometric chip</li>
        <li>has not expired</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To check if your passport has a biometric chip, look for the rectangular biometric chip symbol on the front cover.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">UK biometric residence permit (BRP)</h2>

      <p>You can use a BRP that has not expired. You might have a BRP if you have a visa for longer than 6 months or indefinite leave to remain.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">UK biometric residence card (BRC)</h2>

      <p>This is also called a UK residence card. You can use a BRC that has not expired. You might have a BRC if youâ€™re in the UK as a family member of a citizen from a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">UK Frontier Worker permit (FWP)</h2>

      <p>You can use an FWP that has not expired. You might have an FWP if you work in the UK but live in another country.</p>

  

    
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Do you have any of these types of photo ID?</h2>
