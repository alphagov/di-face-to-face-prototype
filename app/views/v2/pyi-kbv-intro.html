      <p>We can check your passport details and ask you some questions that only you will know. This will help us protect you against online identity theft.</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your UK passport details (including your name, passport number and the date your passport expires)</li>
        <li>your current home address (you might also need your previous address if you've recently moved)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We'll then ask you some questions that only you should know the answers to.</p>

      <p>The questions will be about things like your mobile phone contract, bank account, and any credit cards, loans or mortgages you have. Answering these questions will help us stop anyone else who might have your details from pretending to be you.</p>

      <p>We will not keep your answers.</p>
