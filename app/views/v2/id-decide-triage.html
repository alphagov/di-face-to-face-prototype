     We need to ask some questions to decide how to prove your identity
   </h1>

   <p>You must have at least one of these documents to prove your identity through this service:</p>


   <!-- <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need</h2>

   <p>You might need to create an account and prove your identity before you can apply for a basic DBS check.</p> -->
<!--
   <p>You’ll also need:</p> -->

   <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
     <li>UK passport</li>
     <li>Other passport</li>
     <li>Biometric residence permit (BRP)</li>
     <li>UK driving licence</li>

<div class="">

       <p>It will take you around 15 minutes to prove your identity online. You can do this through an app. If you are not able to use the app, we can check your UK passport details and ask some questions that only you will know.</p>

     <p>We will first ask you some questions to help decide which option is right for you.</p>

               <p>This process will take a lot longer than proving your identity online.</p>
